# Locational Analysis of Mounds in the Yambol province

A script for the processing of environmental data extracted from DEM for burial mound locations indicated in topographic maps for the Yambol province, SE Bulgaria
Frequency tables are calculated for environmental zones in the rasters (ASTER , SRTM) and for mound locations. 
The environmental data used as input was generated through point sampling and raster value extraction to table in QGIS/ArcGIS 

To run this code, run the MQNS.R master file.
